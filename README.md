# Web-developement-frontend
Basic frontend stuff. Started with some basics of HTML making forms and tables. Did CSS and bootstrap used in image gallery. Used javascript along with HTML and CSS for the color guessing game, made a good looking todo-list using jQuery, HTML and CSS ,and finally made that circle game using animations(paperjs) and sounds(howler.js) completing my packadge of frontend developement.
